# SMG PHP Coding Exercise

There are a few issues with this WordPress plugin causing it to error and behave unexpectedly.

Please fix the errors, then the unexpected behavior.
When loaded, this plugin should make the website blank and display: "Great job!" on the website.
Two alerts should appear, in this order: "Great", "job!".

Please create a new GH branch for your work and create pull request.
